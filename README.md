# Getting Started with obniz

Basic examples in Python created for an introductory workshop utilizing "[obniz](https://obniz.io/)." obniz is an easy to use IoT toolkit by CambrianRobotics inc.

## Examples

* `hello_world.py` - Display "Hello, world!" on the OLED display of an obniz board.
* `led.py` - Control an LED connected to an obniz board with the switch on the board.
* `servo_motor.py` - Control a servo motor connected to an obniz board with the switch on the board.

## Components

* An LED with a built-in resistor (e.g., [SparkFun Electronics COM-14977](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14977))
* A servo motor (e.g., [Tower Pro SG90 Digital](http://www.towerpro.com.tw/product/sg90-7/))
* A 0.1" spaced 3-pin male long header, to connect the servo motor to the obniz board (e.g., [SparkFun Electronics PRT-12693](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12693))
